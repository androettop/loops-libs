# Project Setup

<LoopsMeta readingTime={4} author="Pablo Androetto" />

### Introduction

This guide will help you through the process of setting up your development environment,
and it contains all the necessary setup to get you started deploying.

### Running storybook in dev

Clone the repo in your projects directory:

```sh
$ cd ~/projects
$ git clone git@github.com:loops-ar/loops-libs.git
```

Setup the repo configurations (git hooks):

```sh
$ ./setup.sh
```

Build the image with

```sh
$ cd ~/projects/loops-libs
$ ./build --target dev
```

And run the service with this docker-compose file:

```yml
version: "3"
services:
  app:
    image: loops-ar/loops-libs
    environment:
      - APP_ENV=devel
    ports:
      - 4000:3000
    volumes:
      - /home/$USER/projects/loops-libs:/devel
```

> ![ℹ️](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/16x16/2139.png) **This docker-compose exposes the storybook service on port 4000, make sure to not use the same port on your host or in another container.**

### Deploy docker image

You can deploy the docker image with hellesbock

```
$ hellesbock create-release --verbose
```

### Publish packages to verdaccio

The current repository contains a script to publish the packages to verdaccio.

You need to set the NPM_TOKEN env variable before use the script, or call the script setting the NPM_TOKEN env variable at same time.

```sh
$ NPM_TOKEN=<your-token> ./publish <package>
```

**Example**:

```sh
$ NPM_TOKEN=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ./publish ui
```

> ![⚠️](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/16x16/26a0.png) **Before publish you should commit the new version number (Soon automatically with pipelines).**

### Add a new loops-ar package

1. Add the package in the package directory.

   The name of te package in the package.json file should look like this: `{ "name": "@loops-ar/my_package" }`.

2. Add the package in the Dockerfile.

```Dockerfile
...
COPY package.json ./

# Add new packages here
COPY packages/docs/package.json ./packages/docs/
COPY packages/ui/package.json ./packages/ui/
COPY packages/my_package/package.json ./packages/my_package/

RUN npm install --verbose
...
```

3. Add the package in the workspace (package.json)

```json
...
"workspaces": {
    "packages": [
    "packages/ui",
    "packages/docs",
    "packages/generator-loops"
    //Add new packages here
    ]
},
...
```
