# Component creation

<LoopsMeta readingTime={3} author="Pablo Androetto" />

### Introduction

This guide will help you to understand how to create componentes following the atomic design methodology.

### Component generation

You can generate a new component running the following command in your terminal

```
$ ./yarn generate
```

A wizard will guiate to the component creation process, based in [this guide](/docs/·guides-atomic-design--page) you can determine if you need an Atom, or a Molecule, or an Organism...

### Component structure

The base component comes with a file for the component and another file for the styles (an styled-component Component);

### Tips

#### Keep the modularity

If the component (an atom by example) increase they size always you can move it to the superior category (molecule in this example).

#### Whenever possible, use styled components

If you need to create small sub components or parts of a larger component, which are not big enough to be an atom, it is recommended that this is a styled component, this will improve modularization, make styling easier and make it easier to migrate it to an atom if necessary in the future.

#### Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies

Before adding new dependencies in the loops-libs packages, check if there is no existing one that meets the needs. If you are not sure, check with your colleagues
