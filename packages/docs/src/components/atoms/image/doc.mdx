# Image

Image is a component to show an image with many useful props.

## Sample image

The Image components wraps a standard HTML image, so it inherits all the properties of the html element.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="atoms-image--sample-image" />
</Canvas>

## Shape

You can change the shape of the image specifying the props **rounded** or **circle**.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="atoms-image--rounded-shape" />
  <Story id="atoms-image--circle-shape" />
</Canvas>

## Sizing mode

You can change the sizing mode of the image specifying the prop **mode**.

The available modes are:

- **none** (default): the image will be resized to its original size
- **cover**: the image will be resized to cover the container
- **contain**: the image will be resized to contain the container
- **fill**: the image will be resized to fill the container
- **scale-down**: the image will be resized to fit the container, but if it is smaller than the container, it will be displayed at its original size

<Canvas>
  <Story id="atoms-image--sample-image" />

  <Story id="atoms-image--contain-mode" />
  <Story id="atoms-image--fill-mode" />
